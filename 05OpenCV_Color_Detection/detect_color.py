# All we are doing here is defining a list of boundaries in the RGB color space 
# (or rather, BGR, since OpenCV represents images as NumPy arrays in reverse order), 
# where each entry in the list is a tuple with two values: a list of lower limits and 
# a list of upper limits.

# For example, letâ€™s take a look at the tuple ([17, 15, 100], [50, 56, 200]) .

# Here, we are saying that all pixels in our image that have a R >= 100, B >= 15, 
# and G >= 17 along with R <= 200, B <= 56, and G <= 50 will be considered red.

    # The cv2.inRange  function expects three arguments: the first is the image  
    # were we are going to perform color detection, the second is the lower  limit 
    # of the color you want to detect, and the third argument is the upper  limit of 
    # the color you want to detect.

    # After calling cv2.inRange, a binary mask is returned, where white pixels (255) 
    # represent pixels that fall into the upper and lower limit range and black pixels
    # (0) do not.

    # To create the output image, we apply our mask on Line 61. This line simply makes 
    # a call to cv2.bitwise_and, showing only pixels in the image that have a corresponding 
    # white (255) value in the mask.
